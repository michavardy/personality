# Stuck in elevator

## Description
User is going in for a job interview on the 6th floor and the user has exactly 10 minutes before the interviewer has to leave to pick up her daughter. The user is so stressed that the user forgets the user's phone in the user's car. The elevator that the user is in suddenly stops at around floor 5. When the user presses the button to talk with the parking garage manager, the manager repeats over and over that he cannot hear anyone and does not understand if anyone is actually trying to communicate with him. The user looks around and see three other individuals with the user, one of them has a hand dolley, another has his hands on his head rocking back and forth, and the third is standing looking at the user.
